## Introduction

This document describes the motivation behind the project, the problems it aims to solve (from a player perspective), and the desired user experience.

## Executive Summary

The game aims to provide a unique survival horror experience by blending a retro ASCII visual style (with a pseudo-3D twist) with modern, real-time MOBA-like controls and deep survival mechanics. The goal is an unsettling atmosphere where players feel challenged by both the environment and potential threats.

## Key Points [IMPORTANT]

- **Unique Selling Proposition:** Blend of retro ASCII visuals and modern real-time mechanics.
- **Target Experience:** Unsettling atmosphere, challenging survival, engaging real-time combat and exploration.
- **Visual Inspiration:** "Door in the Woods" (ASCII pseudo-3D) but with real-time gameplay.
- **Control Inspiration:** MOBAs like League of Legends (camera and potentially movement).
- **Core Player Loop:** Explore -> Scavenge -> Craft -> Survive -> Combat -> Explore...

## Problem Solved

Many retro-inspired games focus solely on turn-based or simpler mechanics. This project aims to bridge the gap, offering the aesthetic appeal of classic ASCII games but with the dynamic, responsive gameplay found in modern real-time titles, specifically within the survival horror genre.

## How It Should Work (User Experience Goals)

- **Visuals:** Players should immediately recognize the unique ASCII style but perceive a sense of depth and place within the world.
- **Controls:** Movement and camera control should feel intuitive and responsive, allowing for skillful navigation and combat maneuvering, potentially drawing from MOBA paradigms.
- **Survival:** Players should feel the pressure to manage resources, make meaningful choices about crafting, and interact thoughtfully with the environment to survive.
- **Combat:** Combat should feel impactful and require tactical positioning and resource management (if applicable).
- **Atmosphere:** The combination of visuals, sound design (to be added), and gameplay mechanics should create a persistent sense of unease and tension.
- **Interaction:** Interacting with the world (picking up items, opening doors, using objects) should be straightforward and integrated seamlessly into gameplay.
