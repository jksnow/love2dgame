# Memory Bank README

**Status:** [DRAFT] | **Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD | **Version:** 1.0 (DOC-YYYYMMDD-1.0)

## Introduction

This directory contains the "Memory Bank" for the project. It serves as the persistent knowledge base and documentation hub, essential for maintaining context and continuity, especially given that the AI assistant's memory resets between sessions.

## Purpose

The Memory Bank ensures that all critical project information, decisions, context, and progress are accurately documented and easily accessible. It follows a specific structure and set of conventions to maintain clarity and consistency.

## Usage

- **Start of Session:** Always begin by reviewing `index.md` and `activeContext.md`.
- **During Development:** Refer to relevant documents (e.g., `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`). Use `codeDocMap.md` to link code and documentation.
- **End of Session:** Update `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, and any other relevant documents. Log changes in `changelog.md`.

## Structure

The Memory Bank follows a defined hierarchical structure. Refer to the main project guidelines or the `knowledgeGraph.md` (once created) for a visualization.

## Conventions

- Follow the standard document format outlined in the project guidelines.
- Use status tags ([CURRENT], [NEEDS UPDATE], etc.) appropriately.
- Adhere to the specified versioning scheme.
- Use provided templates (`templates/`) when creating new documents.
- Optimize documents for AI consumption (key points, concise language).

## Maintenance

Regular reviews (weekly quick-checks, monthly comprehensive reviews) are crucial. Update documentation promptly after significant changes or decisions.
