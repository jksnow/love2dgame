# Project Progress

**Status:** [CURRENT] | **Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD | **Version:** 1.0 (DOC-YYYYMMDD-1.0)

## Introduction

This document tracks the completion status of major development tasks and components, based on the initial project checklist.

## Executive Summary

Project setup is underway. The Memory Bank foundation is being laid. Core Love2D project files (`main.lua`, `conf.lua`) are the next immediate coding task.

## Key Points [IMPORTANT]

- Tracks high-level task completion.
- Mirrors the initial development checklist.
- Status indicators: [ ] To Do, [WIP] Work in Progress, [DONE] Completed, [BLOCKED] Blocked.

## Development Overview Checklist Status

### Setup & Foundation:

- [ ] Set up Love2D development environment. (Assumed mostly done by user)
- [DONE] Establish basic project structure (folders for assets, libraries, modules, core files).
- [DONE] Create the main game loop (`love.load`, `love.update`, `love.draw`). (Basic structure implemented, delegated to states)
- [DONE] Implement basic state management (e.g., main menu, game state, pause menu).

### Core Visuals - ASCII Pseudo-3D Rendering:

- [WIP] Research and choose a method for ASCII rendering (e.g., tilemap based, direct character drawing). (Focusing on direct character drawing with layering)
- [ ] Design or source an appropriate ASCII character set/font.
- [WIP] Implement the basic top-down rendering engine.
- [ ] Develop the core logic for the "pseudo-3D" effect (representing height/depth with characters/layers).
- [ ] Implement rendering of basic environment tiles.
- [ ] Implement rendering of player character glyph/sprite.

### Player & Camera Control:

- [ ] Implement player character data structure (position, stats, etc.).
- [ ] Implement player movement input handling (e.g., WASD or mouse-click to move like LoL).
- [ ] Implement basic collision detection with environment elements.
- [ ] Implement camera system (following player, potential for LoL-style control - locked/unlocked, edge scrolling).

### Combat System:

- [ ] Design basic combat mechanics (melee/ranged, targeting).
- [ ] Implement player attack actions (input, animation/visual feedback).
- [ ] Implement basic enemy AI (placeholder behavior, pathfinding?).
- [ ] Implement enemy data structure (position, stats, AI state).
- [ ] Implement damage calculation and health system for player and enemies.
- [ ] Implement combat feedback (hit effects, death states).

### Survival Systems:

- **Inventory:**
  - [ ] Design inventory data structure (slots, item data).
  - [ ] Implement item pickup logic.
  - [ ] Implement inventory UI display.
  - [ ] Implement item dropping/using from inventory.
- **Crafting:**
  - [ ] Design crafting system logic (recipes, requirements).
  - [ ] Implement crafting UI.
  - [ ] Implement crafting execution (consuming resources, creating items).
- **Interaction:**
  - [ ] Design interaction system (defining interactable objects/points).
  - [ ] Implement interaction prompts/detection.
  - [ ] Implement interaction actions (e.g., open door, read note, gather resource).

### World & Content:

- [ ] Design map/level structure (how levels are defined/loaded).
- [ ] Implement level loading system.
- [ ] Create tools or define formats for designing levels (e.g., using Tiled Map Editor).
- [ ] Populate the world with initial environment details, items, resources, and enemies.
- [ ] Consider basic narrative elements/lore delivery (if applicable).

### UI/UX:

- [ ] Design and implement Heads-Up Display (HUD) elements (health, resources, etc.).
- [ ] Implement main menu and pause menu functionality.
- [ ] Refine inventory, crafting, and interaction UIs for clarity and ease of use.
- [ ] Provide necessary feedback for player actions.

### Audio:

- [ ] Integrate an audio library/use Love2D's built-in audio.
- [ ] Implement sound effects for actions (movement, combat, interaction, UI).
- [ ] Add background music and atmospheric sounds.

### Lighting:

- [ ] Design basic lighting system principles (e.g., ambient light, point lights).
- [ ] Implement light value calculation for map cells.
- [ ] Modify rendering to apply lighting to tile colors.

### Refinement & Polish:

- [ ] Balance gameplay mechanics (combat difficulty, resource availability).
- [ ] Optimize performance (drawing, updates, AI).
- [ ] Fix bugs identified during testing.
- [ ] Add "juice" - small visual/audio details that enhance feel.

## Known Issues / Blockers

- None currently identified.
