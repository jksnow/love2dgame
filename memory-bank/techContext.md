# Technical Context

**Status:** [DRAFT] | **Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD | **Version:** 1.0 (DOC-YYYYMMDD-1.0)

## Introduction

This document outlines the core technologies, development environment, technical constraints, and dependencies for the project.

## Executive Summary

The project is built using the Love2D framework, requiring Lua for scripting. The primary technical challenge lies in implementing the efficient real-time ASCII pseudo-3D rendering engine. Development relies on a standard Love2D setup.

## Key Points [IMPORTANT]

- **Framework:** Love2D (Latest stable version recommended)
- **Language:** Lua (Version compatible with Love2D)
- **Core Challenge:** Real-time ASCII pseudo-3D rendering.
- **Dependencies:** Primarily Love2D itself. External Lua libraries may be added for specific features (e.g., state management, pathfinding, UI) as needed.
- **Development Environment:** Standard text editor/IDE (like VS Code/Cursor), Love2D runtime.

## Technologies Used

- **Love2D:** The core game framework handling windowing, input, drawing, audio, physics (if used), etc.
- **Lua:** The scripting language used for all game logic within Love2D.

## Development Setup

1.  Install Love2D (ensure it's added to the system PATH).
2.  Use a text editor or IDE with Lua support (e.g., VS Code with Lua extensions, Cursor).
3.  Project Structure: (See `projectbrief.md` or main guidelines - initial setup includes `src/`, `assets/`, `lib/`, `memory-bank/`)
4.  Running the game: `love .` in the project's root directory (containing `main.lua`).

## Technical Constraints

- Performance: The ASCII rendering, especially with pseudo-3D effects and real-time updates, needs to be optimized to run smoothly.
- Love2D Limitations: Be mindful of any specific limitations or performance characteristics of the Love2D framework.
- Lua Performance: Lua is generally fast, but complex calculations or large data structures should be handled efficiently.

## Dependencies

- **Required:** Love2D Runtime
- **Optional (Potential):**
  - State Management Library (e.g., hump.gamestate)
  - UI Library
  - Collision Library (if Love2D's physics is not used)
  - Pathfinding Library (e.g., Jumper)
  - Serialization Library

_(Specific libraries will be documented here as they are chosen and integrated)_
