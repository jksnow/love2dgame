# Project Brief: ASCII Survival Horror

**Status:** [DRAFT] | **Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD | **Version:** 1.0 (DOC-YYYYMMDD-1.0)

## Introduction

This document outlines the core concept and high-level goals for the Love2D survival horror game project.

## Executive Summary

The project aims to create a real-time survival horror game using the Love2D framework. It will feature a unique top-down ASCII rendering style simulating a pseudo-3D perspective, combined with MOBA-like controls, combat, inventory management, crafting, and environmental interaction.

## Key Points [IMPORTANT]

- **Engine:** Love2D (Lua)
- **Genre:** Real-time Survival Horror
- **Visual Style:** Top-down ASCII art with a pseudo-3D effect (like "Door in the Woods").
- **Gameplay:** Real-time action, MOBA-style controls (e.g., League of Legends), combat, survival mechanics.
- **Core Mechanics:** Player movement, camera control, combat, inventory, crafting, environmental interaction.
- **Atmosphere:** Unsettling, horror-focused.
- **Development Aid:** Cursor AI assistance throughout.

## Core Requirements

1.  **ASCII Pseudo-3D Rendering:** Implement a rendering system that uses ASCII characters to create a top-down view with a sense of depth.
2.  **Real-Time Gameplay:** All core actions (movement, combat, interaction) occur in real-time.
3.  **MOBA-Inspired Controls:** Implement player movement and camera controls similar to those found in MOBAs.
4.  **Survival Systems:** Include mechanics for inventory management, resource scavenging, and item crafting.
5.  **Combat System:** Develop mechanics for players to engage with threats in the game world.
6.  **Environmental Interaction:** Allow players to interact with objects and elements within the game environment.

## Scope

The initial scope focuses on establishing the core engine, rendering, controls, and fundamental survival/combat systems. Level design, extensive content creation, narrative elements, and advanced AI will be addressed subsequently. See `progress.md` for a detailed task breakdown.
